title: Internal geophysics in Les Houches
---
# The school

The school will combine formal classes, hands-on tutorials,
round-table discussions and research seminars on the structure,
dynamics and evolution of the Earth interior. It is aimed at PhD
students and young researchers.

# Program (preliminary)

* Geodynamics: Core dynamics, mantle dynamics, core formation, geo- and palaeomagnetism, geodynamo theory, core-mantle coupling.
* Earth structure seen from its gravity field.
* Seismology: body waves, normal modes and surface waves, inverse problem theory, seismic tomography, structure near the core-mantle boundary.
* Mineral physics: Crystal structure, deformation mechanisms, ab initio calculations, physical properties of the core and mantle.
* Geochemistry: heterogeneity of the mantle, evolution of the Earth, core formation, magma ocean processes.

**The school will primarily be in english**

# Multi-disciplinary discussions

* Rheology.
* Mixing and heterogeneities.
* Open science: community-led journal, community codes, open data.

# Application

Owing to COVID-19 restrictions, the number of participants is limited
to 25 (39 including lecturers). Candidates must send mail to
S. Labrosse (stephane.labrosse (at) ens-lyon.fr) and B. Romanowicz
(barbara.romanowicz (a) college-de-france.fr ) stating:
* Lastname, firstname
* Number of years in PhD or postdoc
* Primary field (e.g. geodynamics, mineral physics, seismology etc.)
* Subject of PhD or postdoc project

Each candidate must also ask their advisor to send us a short support
letter. 

**Application deadline: June 7, 2021**

# Location

[Les Houches school of Physics](https://www.houches-school-physics.com/)
is located in Les Houches, at the entrance of the Chamonix valley, at
the foot of the Mont-Blanc, in the French Alps. It offers all
necessary facilities, with a lecture room (70 seats, see image by Ed Garnero), several rooms
