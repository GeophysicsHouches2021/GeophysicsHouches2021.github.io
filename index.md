# The school

The school will combine formal classes, hands-on tutorials,
round-table discussions and research seminars on the structure,
dynamics and evolution of the Earth interior. It is aimed at PhD
students and young researchers.

# Program

* Mornings, starting at 9:00am, two classes of 1:30 each.
* Afternoons, starting at 4:30pm, a class and 1 seminar.

  the [school youtube chanel](https://www.youtube.com/c/EcoledePhysiquedesHouches/videos).

**The school will primarily be in english**

# Multi-disciplinary discussions
* Rheology.
* Mixing and heterogeneities.
* Open science: community-led journal, community codes, open data.

# Presentations by participants
