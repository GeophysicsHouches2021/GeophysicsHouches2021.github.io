# Application

Owing to COVID-19 restrictions, the number of participants is limited
to 25.

The housing and food is covered by our sponsors: [Labex LIO](https://lio.universite-lyon.fr/) and [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/en).

# Location

[Les Houches school of Physics](https://www.houches-school-physics.com/)
is located in Les Houches, at the entrance of the Chamonix valley, at
the foot of the Mont-Blanc, in the French Alps. It offers all
necessary facilities, with a lecture room (70 seats, see image by Ed Garnero), several rooms
for group working, internet access, a restaurant and chalets for
housing. The price of school includes food, lodging and access to all
facilities for the four weeks.
